    text: `You are Sagard.

You are sixteen years old.

A mistral wind howls across the icy moors, blowing back your thick dark hair. On the horizon, jagged peaks of the mountains that form Ratik’s border gnaw at the sky like wolves’ teeth. Below you is your tribal village. Your tribe is small, with scarcely three hundred members. You live as hunters, trading pelts for those things you need from the civilized world. Mostly, however, you shun the soft life of those who are civilized and prefer to think of yourselves as the Strong - people of iron.

A tall plume of white smoke rises from the chimney of a wood and stone building. The door opens and a tall, muscular warrior steps out, laughing into the waning dusk. Wafts of song and loud bragging pour out after him. When the door swings shut, the Warriors’ Lodge is once again silent.

All your life you have wanted to enter the Warriors’ Lodge, but you are not yet a warrior. Though your thews are strong and you have already reached a height of over six feet, the warriors think you are still a boy. You will not be a warrior until you pass the Ordeal of Courage.

In Ratik there are no laws - only customs, which are stronger than laws to your tribe. One day you will set out on your Ordeal of Courage. You must perform a brave deed and bring back a trophy as proof. Your trophies, whatever they may be - the fang from a deathviper or the scalp of a mountain bandit - will be presented before the warriors. They shall eye them and fondle them, and you  shall tell your tale. If they approve, the elk’s-horn chalice shall be passed to you. But if they find no might in your deed, you will be greeted with echoing laughter and forced to leave the hut in shame, never again to return to your tribe.

There is no set age for the Ordeal of Courage. Some men have grown old in the village without ever putting themselves through the Ordeal. But they are not warriors. They are kwads and are treated as lessers. You are no kwad. You are to become a warrior, and tonight you shall begin the Ordeal of Courage.

To the west lie the Rakers, a dark mountain vastness. They are largely unmapped, though legends have placed strange and dangerous creatures there. Some tales tell of great treasures, others of vague rumors of an Ice Dragon. To the south is the Marsh, where Painted Frustis roam. It is said that an ancient structure, the Lost Colosseum, was built in the ancient antediluvian age when the northern lands were a jungle. The land it now stands on is an ice-covered wasteland.`,

    text: `As custom dictates, you stealthily slipped away from your home without telling a soul,
arming yourself with a spear, a dagger, twenty silver coins, a cloak, a skin of wine, and a flint sparking kit.

Night blanketed Ratik as you left. Reaching the summit of the first mountain, you could not help but look back at the small village where you have lived all of your life.

You criticized yourself for this, because a true Ratikkan is taught to be suspicious of all things that resemble civilization. Nevertheless, tonight was the first time you had strayed far from the warm fires of your village, which flickered behind you like the last embers of a dying fire.

The snow-crested mountains glow in the moonlight as you cross into the valley. Ahead of you and above you, faintly swirling like drifting smoke, is a long, narrow pass. Night winds howl, and stray bits of icy snow sting your eyes. Instinct tells you it would be best to negotiate that path during the day when vision is clear. Not far away, you notice a dark recess in the mountain wall. Stepping closer, you find that it is a yawning cave.

Stooping your massive frame slightly, you enter the cave. It is still inside, removed from the howling wind. Striking a flint to spark some tinder, you create a small fire. In its light you see that this will be a good place to spend the night.

Suddenly, you hear a low growl. The hair at the nape of your neck stands up, and your skin turns to gooseflesh. Your eyes scan the cave. A pure white Mountain Lion eyes you hungrily. Its teeth are bared, and it is poised to leap for your throat. You have never before encountered a Mountain Lion so large. To fight it may mean pain or even death, but to stray into the night will mean certain injury from cold.`,

at your flesh.

At the top of the trail, your flesh tingles. You sense that something unnatural is near you. Instinct tells you to flee back down the hill, but what you see stops you.

Coming up the trail are five menacing figures. They are shaped like humans, but light glimmers off them. Through their transparent bodies, you see the distant stars and mountains. Long ago, in the comfort of your bed, you were told a tale of the Frost Fighters. Never did you think you would come face to face with one.

You are seized with a cold, inhuman fear. Were you to run back down the hill, you would present your back to the Frost Fighters and be skewered on a long icicle spear.

You must fight the Frost Fighters, but you may use one of two strategies. You may attack, receiving a bonus of 4 surprise attacks, or you may move to a large crevasse near you, thus ensuring that only one Frost Fighter may attack you at a time.`,

Walking against the driving wind, you cross the summit of the mountain and discover below you a tiny, pleasant valley where there is no snow.
        
Arriving in the valley, you find that the floor is covered with warm pine needles, and by a fluke of nature, this valley, out of the wind, retains the sun’s heat. You can sleep soundly in this place. A night’s sleep restores **5 HP**.`,

you have seen no humans, nor encountered any dangerous beasts. However, progress has been very slow; you have not yet found a path.

At noon on the third day, you spot a wide mountain path, which is not shown on any map you have seen of Ratik. You deduce by observing the deep, rutted wagon tracks that it is some kind of a trade route.
        
To gain distance before nightfall, you jog quickly down the path. Cold wind chills your lungs, but warm blood courses in your veins. As you round a narrow curve, your ears are struck by the shrill squeaking of unoiled wagon wheels. Quickly, you climb a narrow pass and hide behind a large boulder.
        
Moments later, a gaudily designed caged wagon comes into view, and your suspicions grow. Two Medigian Traders in the civilized dress of those who inhabit the Great Kingdom lead a team of stout but aged horses.
        
On top of the wagon and hanging from the sides are a variety of wares. Your eyes settle on a beautiful sword which hangs just behind the riders.
        
From your hiding place, you hear the mournful please of a Ratikkan woman, and you spy her in the cage. She is drawing a worn cloak of animal skin around her scantily clad body. “Please release me; I have two children I must watch after,” she pleads.
        
The driver of the wagon laughs a throaty laugh. “You will bring many silver pieces in the slave markets or Atirr. Your children will have to watch after themselves.”
        
His partner on the carriage beats the cage with a slaver’s club, drowning out the woman’s pleas. Her voice breaks down to sobbing.
        
You feel your hackles rise as you assess the two traders. One is a stout, tough fellow, who looks as if much of his time has been spent in the Ratikkan Mountains; the other is younger and, with a slightly grayish cast to his skin, looks as if he might have a bit of Orc in his lineage.
        
Were you to jump from your perch to the wagon, you would achieve nearly total surprise; however, there are two traders and only one of you. Fear dictates that you let the wagon pass. You do not know the woman, for she is not of your tribe. You wonder whether it is worth risking limb, or even death, by attacking the traders. A third option crosses your mind: you might barter with the traders for the sword. Though swords are often expensive in Raitk, you have heard of great bargains on swords purchased from traders.`,

In the cool blue light of the moon and stars, you see that the traders have set up camp nearby. You are on a small path in a large, dark forest. One of the traders gazes into the night, keeping watch. The other turns over lazily in a sleeping bag and snores.

regaining your senses, you are awakened by a bellowing voice. “You have failed in all you have attempted. You have failed to defeat a pair of foolish traders from the Medigian Kingdom, and you have run away from saving a woman of your own race. Thus far, I have protected you, Sagard, but the god Telchur is no friend to the cowardly or the weak. From this moment, you must behave as a Ratikkan warrior - or die!”

Your eyes clear. Though you remember your hideous fight, you feel no pain from it. Your HP are restored to their full 20.
        
Hovering over you is the powerful, menacing form of a Valkyrie. “Telchur!” you exclaim. She is a beautiful form, very tall and strong. Her long blond hair falls to her breastplate. At her side she wears an Aesir sword of gleaming blue metal.
        
You start to speak, but her voice cuts through. “To regain your manhood, you must enter the cave of the Ice Dragon and retrieve his heart. No other task will redeem you!” This task will take all of the courage and strength you can muster. Death will probably come to you for it. Death, however, shall come as a friend, because it will be a hero’s death.
        
“To accomplish this end, I shall give you a sword. It is a proud sword; carry it as such.” Your eyes are struck by the blue glint of the sword in her hand. It is a beautiful weapon. She hands it down to you, and you admire it. Beautiful runes are etched on its sides. This sword will give you added fighting ability.
        
As long as you carry this **sword**, you add 1 point of damage to all of your attacks. Give up your life before you give up this sword.
        
While you admire the amazing weapon, the Valkyrie’s voice bells on: “You will find the Ice Dragon beyond where the Valley of Glare ends! Get on your way!” As if carried by an invisible force, you rise from your seat and dash to the door. Once again, you are alone in the woods.
        
You look in all directions, and know not which to take. “Follow the southern star, fool.” Seeing the southern star, you dash off.`,

you stumble toward the bear. The Medigian Traders lie lifeless on the ground. From behind, you hear a voice. “Though your thews are strong, your heart is weak.”

You turn, and there stands the Ratikkan woman! She looks strangely different from how you remember her. She seems much larger and radiates a weird light. Her torn peasant cloak has fallen from her to reveal the scantily clad form of a much younger woman than you had thought. The moonlight reflects off the taut muscles in her abdomen and thighs. She raises her hands like a witch. From the ends of her fingers shoot spears of blue light. The spears strike the fallen traders, as if to make sure of their demise.
        
A sudden chill overtakes you as her eyes let off a strange blue radiance. “I am not the humble Ratikkan woman you mistook me for. I am a Valkyrie. I was merely riding with the traders to learn of their route. Were I to tell your tribesmen of your cowardice, you would be banished forever, but that is not my wish. It is my wish to see you grow up a true Ratikkan warrior. For that reason, I grant you reprieve.”
        
Your eyes are locked to this strange apparition. You do not dare cross her, because you realize that she would strike you down in a moment. “You are to claim the heart of the Ice Dragon and return it to your tribe, or die on the quest.”
        
She raises her hands again, and another bluish glow comes from them; this time, it radiates to your sword, surrounds it in a steely, icy energy, and settles. The sword you borrowed from the trader now looks and feels different, lighter and stronger. Strange runes appear on its side.
        
This **sword** will work well for you. The weapon will add 1 damage point every time you attack.

The Ratikkan woman holds a strange lantern that bathes you in a warm, powerful light. So completely has she changed that you barely recognize her. Moments ago, in the cage, she had appeared to be a scared tribewife. Now, scantily clad in a tight fur outfit, wearing a broadsword and the horns of a Valkyrie, she is a person of great power. “One day you may make a great warrior,” she says.
        
“A Valkyrie!” you mutter, not fully regaining your voice.
        
She laughs wildly. “Many Ratikkan women have been kidnapped and sold into slavery in evil foreign lands. I set out to trace the route, to give them a taste of blunt steel.”
        
“I have ruined your plan.”
        
She laughs. “There will be other traders to ride with. And for you, there will be another test of courage.” She draws the broadsword from the belt at her supple waist. “In the mountains to the south, there are rumored to be the remnants of an ice empire. The empire has long since passed into history, but it is said that it is still guarded by the legendary Ice Dragon. Bring the Ice Dragon’s heart to Ratik and you will become a warrior of great renown.” She holds the broadsword out, hilt forward. “Do you accept the quest?” she asks.
        
With your voice choked, you nod yes.

Suddenly, his eyes bulge and he collapses like a marionette whose strings have been cut. His body tumbles to the ground next to you, and his head rolls a few feet away. Standing in his place is the Ratikkan woman, though she looks greatly changed from when you last saw her. Gone is the tattered shawl that covered her.

She stands before you nearly naked, save for a scanty fur tunic which is cut low at her chest and ends several inches above her knees. At her side she wears a drinking horn and a broadsword. You wonder where she had concealed this weapon when you rode in the wagon, but it is not for you to know such things about the servants of the god Telchur. On her head, she wears the distinctive silver horns of a Valkyrie.
        
“Telchur!” you mutter.
        
“One day, you shall be a great warrior, but there is much for you to learn.” Before the blackness of death can overtake you, she bends down and holds the Horn of Redemption to your mouth. In moments, your full barbarian strength returns to you. You regain all of your **HP**.
        
“I have saved you from death, but should you come so close again, nothing can save you. In return for this gift of life, you will carry out my will, for it is a mission that only one of your strength might accomplish.”
        
You sit up, not comprehending your sudden surge of strength and vigor, and not believing that you had been so completely tricked by the Valkyrie.
        
“To the south lie the mountains. Secreted in the tallest mountain of the range, a dormant volcano, from which rise great plumes of steam, is the Ice King’s Hall. There, so legend has it, dwells the Ice Dragon, a hearty beast with a ruby heart. Take the heart, and bring it to your tribe. It will be a trophy people will speak of for many ages.”
        
She wipes her broadsword off with a cloth and hands it to you. It is a powerful-looking weapon. The cold light of the moon reflects the blue glint of prize steel, and strange runes carved in the blade seem to slither and alter their shapes. “Take this weapon. It will stand you in good stead through combat.”
        
You admire the weapon. It would take the lifelong earnings of several men to pay for such a sword. “And what payment do you ask from me?” you ask her.
        
She smiles. “That you have courage.”
        
You take the **weapon** into your callused hand. The sword will help you. In all combat, you will do 1 extra damage point to your enemies.`,

Many have walked these stones before you: the Gondorians who laid them, the Aerdians, the Hitaxian Merchants, the Priests of the Scarlet Brotherhood, and wild adventurers from all lands.
        
At the end of the path stands a large, cracked stadium that was built by the ancient Gondorians. Viewing its craftsmanship and nearly perfect symmetrical design, you can almost hear the roar of gladiator contests. Admiring it, you pause to wonder what other great structures these clever and industrious people built.
        
Little is actually known of the Gondorians, but myth recounts them as a great civilization which thrived in ancient times. It is said that all people of this world are descended from them, for in the moments before their destruction (which some say was by earthquake and others claim was by divine conflagration), they sent out the one hundred greatest men and women of their world to begin a new one.

Following the smoke, you come upon two small, tattered skin tents. Stalking closer, you can detect nothing of interest in the camp, save for an ornately painted Tehnite shield. You know not what the strange men of Tehn are doing this far east, but you lust for the shield.

Toward dawn, you stop to rest. The night fog lifts, and along the eastern horizon is the pink band of light that presages the sun’s rising. In the distance you hear the low roar of thunder. A gust of wind picks up your hair and blows it back.

You break out your flint and steel kit to begin a fire. A sickly sweet smell strikes your nose. It is neither a natural herb nor a flower, though it smells like a combination of several flowers. It could only be some ghastly concoction of civilization.

Whirling around, you see a silver blur. Instinctively, you dive away as the blade of a broadsword swishes over your head. Scrambling for your spear, you see your opponent as he lumbers slowly toward you. He is a knight of some sort in gleaming silver armor. Atop his head is a fluttering plume.

His armor is thick, but by the way he handles his sword you can see that he is no great fighter. It is your guess that he is a soldier from the North Province. You could outrun him, but your eyes fix on a possible **trophy** - the **plume** on his head.

You have been to this hut once before, but never have you seen the sage, for you were young and the elders made you wait outside. The sage is a man of great knowledge, but you have also heard dark tales about him.

At first, the hut is a mere speck at the top of a tall, unnatural mound, but as you climb, the hut grows larger.
        
The hut, which is of haphazard construction, is blanketed in a swirling mist. At first you knock softly, then you bang on the door. For several moments you hear nothing but a strange creaking on the other side. Impatient, you enter the hut. It is dark and gloomy inside.
        
Strange text, maps, and objects of witchcraft litter the room, which seems to have no order. Seeing nobody in the hut, you step to a table where a map lies open. Before you reach the map, however, a cold hand reaches out of the gloom and grabs your shoulder.
        
“Do not turn around, Ratikkan. What is it that brings you to my hut?”
        
A shiver runs up your spine. “I am in search of the Ice Dragon,” you respond.
        
“And you thought you could spy the information from my map without paying the cost,” the deep, gravelly voice says.
        
You resist the urge to turn around. “There was no answer at your door. I will pay your cost if it be reasonable.”
        
“That sword will do nicely,” the sage says eagerly.
        
“It was given to me by a Valkyrie. You overvalue your information.”
        
A low, rumbling laugh comes from behind you. “If you do not give it to me, you will have to fight me for it.”
        
Your eyes struggle vainly for a mirror or another object that will tell you how mighty he is, but you see none. Knowing nothing of this menacing Frusti, you must make the decision of whether to fight or give him the sword.`,

Before you stands the sage. He is a giant of a man with a fiery red beard and a wild tangle of red hair which hangs down onto his furred cape and bare chest. In his hand is an enormous two-handed axe.

Before you is a massive wooden doorway with strange Gondorian runes carved in the icy walls on either side of it. A bridge leads to the doorway. Under the bridge, an icy river rushes by.

Looking over your shoulder, you see a circular dome of ice that looks like a frozen fountain. You haven’t come this far to turn around, so you set out to see what is behind the gigantic door.
        
While crossing the bridge that leads to the door, you hear a strange creaking. Suddenly, the bridge gives way!
        
In a desperate leap, you jump to the far side of the bridge. Feet firmly on the ground, you turn to see the bridge plummet into the icy abyss below.
        
You are trapped on the far side of the river. There is no way back.
        
At the bottom of the door is a massive keyhole. Only a fool would have trouble opening it. Using the tip of your dagger, you release each tumbler, turn the handle, and pull the door toward you.
        
No sooner do you open the door than a windy, low-pitched roar, like wind across an icy plain, rumbles forth.
        
There stands the most deadly creature you have ever seen: the Ice Golem!
        
Its massive structure nearly fills the doorway. It is made of ice and is transparent, except for its glowing blue eyes. In its hands, it holds a massive, dagger-sharp icicle, which it is ready to drive through your body!
        
There is no way to flee the Ice Golem. In combat, it would destroy you. Strong magic or allies will be needed if you ever hope to fight it. Your only hope is to slide past it. Your only advantage is speed.
        
As it lumbers toward you with its deadly icicle, you plot a way to slip between its legs and into the unknown room beyond, from which you can only see an eerie green glow.`,

The Ghosts swing harmlessly at you as you investigate the room. By all appearances, you are in an ancient crypt, probably pre-Gondorian.

Turning, you shudder to see several of the pale creatures staring at you. They stand in a semicircle, closing in on you. None of them appears to be armed, and their bulbous eyes seem to be pleading to you. However, they say nothing, and the silence is more chilling than anything these haunted creatures could say.
        
“Who are you?” you ask, but they give no response. The circle closes, their long, bony hands touching you, their gaunt, cadaverous faces turning toward you. You do not know how to handle them. You reach for your sword, but it is not in your code to wantonly slaughter the weak and helpless. These creatures, if they aren’t dead already, are certainly helpless. Looking closer, you realize that they have no ears.
        
In moments the crowd parts, and standing before you is a pale man, different from the others. Your eyes meet. His eyes are as dark as death itself.
        
Then he mutters in a language you don’t understand. A strange transformation occurs in the crowd. They drop to their knees and stare up at you in awe.
        
“For centuries we have waited for the man who would defeat the ghosts of Aldilusia. You are that man. We offer all that we have.”
        
“I did nothing,” you say. “They are ghosts. I am flesh. That which is not made of matter cannot harm that which is.”
        
“You are our savior. Now we can leave this place where we have been trapped for generations.”
        
A strange procession begins. The cloistered people pass before you with trinkets of their squalid existence: mushrooms, batskins, various mosses, and pale fruits and vegetables. None of the things they bring you is of any particular value, save for a weird type of **glowmoss**. It has been their sustenance in these times - a powerful protein substance that will immediately restore you to your full strength of **20 HP** when you eat it. Glowmoss will work only one time; only use it when you are in most desperate need.
        
So as not to offend these timid and gentle people, you take several of their offerings before leading them out of the cave. Once outside, the pale people shield their eyes from the great light, break into song, and proceed up the valley after once again expressing their gratitude.
        
Except for a **stuffed bat** which you will keep as a trophy, you discard all of the other things they have given you. When they are gone, you are right back where you began. You gain **1 XP**.`,

Following the faint whispers through the labyrinthine trail of the corridors, you come upon a large, open area.
        
The ice-encrusted remains of dozens of tables litter the room. In the far corner stands a very long table with cooking implements hung on the wall behind it. At one time Gondorians took their meals here.
        
Stalking quietly, you see two humans huddling behind the remains of a broken table. They do not see you; their attention is fixed on a doorway on the opposite side of the room.
        
You can make out very little of the two men. They are dressed all in white and hold long spears and nets.
        
It is not long before you see why they are lying in wait. Blocking out the far doorway, like a cloud over the sun, is the massive structure of a furred beast. Your heart pounds, for you had believed that this beast only existed in legends of the deep snow countries. It is white… terrible… a Yeti!
        
The Yeti is nearly the size of the Ice Golem and is part human, part bear, and part something else. As its burning yellow eyes scan the room, you get the cold feeling that it sees you.
        
The two hunters suddenly stand up and hurl their spears, striking the massive beast. The Yeti screams in rage and rips at the air with its claws. A terrible battle is about to begin, pitting men against the Yeti - an angry, tough, and desperate opponent.
        
The pelt of the Yeti would be a trophy to hang proudly in the hunters’ cabin; however, it will be a fight to the death. A Yeti, which prizes the secrecy of its own race above all, will never let any human who discovers it escape.`,

You enter the last corridor. It is a long, narrow passageway. At the far end is a large metal door. Before the door stand four men clad in furs and holding long, pointed weapons.
        
The men see you.
        
“Who dares to test the will of the Zokapers and threaten the Ice Dragon? Surrender now or be cut to ribbons!” one of the men shoults.
        
Your muscles tense. You do not take orders from men. “I am Sagard. If you want me, you will have to come and get me.”
        
Suddenly, the four men charge. You draw your gleaming sword and brace for the attack. It will be a desperate battle, but the Ice Dragon rests on the other side of it.`,

A Zokaper, lying wounded on the ground, mutters to you. “If you promise not to harm the Ice Dragon, I will tell you of a secret way out of here.”
        
You gaze down at him. You already have enough trophies to impress your tribe. A duel with the Ice Dragon could be lethal.
        
“If you cut the heart from the Ice Dragon, all here will be destroyed,” the wounded Zokaper mutters. “Do you know yet what this place is?”
        
You contemplate the question. For what purpose did the Gondorians build this unnatural hall of ice? What has caused it to sustain itself for all of the centuries since the destruction of Gondoria? What might the Ice Dragon be?
        
“What is this place?” you ask the defeated Zokaper.
        
“That I cannot tell you. I have been sworn to secrecy. I will only tell you how to escape from it.”

You take the **key** as a trophy and pace to the door. As you open it, sunlight floods through the door, nearly blinding you. From deep inside the cave, the roar of the Ice Dragon grows louder. It is as if the heat from opening the door made him angry.
        
On stepping into the brilliant sunlight of a warm winter afternoon in Ratik, you understand the nature of the Ice Dragon’s lair.`,

    text: `Ignoring warnings from the Zokaper, you proceed down the corridor. On the other side of a massive iron door, which you assume was built to keep the Ice Dragon in, you hear a soft, purring roar. It sounds as if the Ice Dragon is asleep.

Gently, you open the door, which, much to your surprise, is neither locked nor very heavy. Certainly no such door would contain a demon as menacing as the Ice Dragon.
        
Peering in, you see the Ice Dragon. Reclining at the far side of the room, the Ice Dragon has no fur, scales, or flesh. Nor does it have legs, though several arms rise from its body and attach to the wall, looking more like metal tentacles than animal limbs.
        
Your entrance has not disturbed the Ice Dragon’s slumber; it still rests, and from the dust on the floor, you guess it has not moved in a very long time, if ever.
        
In the center of the Ice Dragon, sealed in a crystal box, you see its heart. It is a brilliantly glowing ruby of enormous size. From a hole in the roof nearly a hundred feet up come several rays of light which shine on the gigantic jewel from above. From the bottom of the heart beams a single intense ray of light which hits a spinning platform.
        
Puzzled, you realize that the Ice Dragon is not a creation of nature, but something fashioned by the clever hands of the Gondorians. Somehow, though your mind does not truly comprehend the physical marvels of the ancients, the smell of magic fills the place. You feel that the Ice Dragon is responsible for the chill of this strange building you have been in.
        
As you contemplate how you might steal the jewel, several fists pound on a door not far from you, and you hear a shout: “Let us out!”
        
“Who are you that I should let you out?” you call back.
        
“We are the Teknikans, keepers of the Ice Dragon. We mean you no harm. We are prisoners.”
        
You have been tricked by the pleas of men before. It would be easy to steal the heart of the Ice Dragon and flee, but the warning of the Zokaper rings in your ears. “If you cut the heart from the Ice Dragon, all here will be destroyed.”`,

Climbing atop the Ice Dragon confirms your suspicions that it is not a living creature - at least, not living in the way that animals of the forest live. Reaching the heart, you discover that it is held in place only by two metal rods. Brandishing your sword, you hack first at one bolt, then the other, and the throbbing stops. The Ice Dragon is dead.
        
Catching the ruby, which is nearly the size of your fist, you jump off the dragon and race for the door.
        
You hear the Teknikans call to you. “You have killed the Ice Dragon. It will be the end for us if you do not let us out now. You know not what you have done.”
        
Hearing the pleading voices, your heart knows pity, an emotion almost totally foreign to you. You consider saving them. Stopping at the door and contemplating, you hear sounds from inside the massive structure.
        
In the far distance, you hear loud cracking sounds. It is as if, when the Ice Dragon died, the whole place came to life. Terror seizes you.`,

You have had a great adventure, but now you have very little proof for the warriors, only your sword and the trophies you stashed before exploring the Ice Dragon's lair.

A red glow in the river catches your eye. You rise and step toward it. Reaching into the water, your hand comes up with the **heart of the Ice Dragon**. Alone in the wilderness, you shout for joy.
        
Later, you make your way back to where you stashed your other trophies. You pick them up and head back to your tribe.`,

“That is my quest,” you say.
        
“We shall remove it for you if you will help us in battle with the Ice Golem,” he says.
        
“That is a fair exchange,” you say.
        
“You look as if you have been wounded. Let us apply our medical techniques to you.”
        
“Keep your magic away from me!” you respond.
        
“This is not magic. This is science,” one of the Teknikans protests. Before you can respond, he rubs some kind of healing salve on your wounds.
        
At first it stings, and you bitterly complain; however, in a few minutes your wounds recover, and you regain your full strength of **20 HP**. 
        
Meanwhile, the little men remove the stone from the Ice Dragon. When this is done, the loud throbbing stops.

The head Teknikan casts you a sympathetic look and replies, “Yes, he is dead.”

Halfway across the field of ice, you see the hulking shape of the Ice Golem. He looms in the doorway like an immobile boulder. There is no choice but to fight him and destroy him, and you know that the Teknikans will be of little help.
        
Drawing closer to the Ice Golem, you see that he is melting like the rest of the building. His exterior, which before was hard and shiny, is now moist and rutted. Fighting the Ice Golem will be difficult but, unlike before, this time you have a chance.`,

Give us all of your trophies, except your warrior’s weapon, so that we may hang them on the wall of honor. Tomorrow, you shall journey with a small band in search of plunder.”

The Elder turns to the other warriors. “Rise so that we might welcome Sagard to the Warriors’ Lodge.”
        
A warm glow fills you while your heart pounds, and a foaming goblet of warm ale is passed into your hands. The warriors cheer.

Congratulations!`,

One day, Sagard, your name may be known throughout the Flanaess of all Oerth. It is with humble respect that I turn over the chieftainship of the tribe to you.”

As the Elder walks toward you, bearing the Sword of Steel, symbol of chieftainship, a surge of wild fury bubbles in your blood.
        
“I can accept no such prize,” you say, “for my fate is not to be tied to one tribe forever. I must roam the world as the wolf does, not stand in one place like the cow. Take these things I have brought to you and place them on the wall of honor, so that I shall be remembered.
        
“For tonight, I shall quaff with you, but when the sun rises I shall take my weapon and depart.”`,

You fall backward and slide down a long, snow-covered slope, the cold night wind whistling through your hair. As you fall, you realize you are descending to a deep valley. Suddenly, your head strikes something and all goes black.

Later, you feel a warm wind blowing on you. Groggy, you crawl to a mountain stream and drink of its fresh mineral waters before returning to a deep slumber. You regain **5 HP**.`,

“Prepare to die, Ratikkan!” a voice calls. You hear another crack and then several loud splashes. Turning, you see the Poachers sinking under the broken ice. Summoning all of your strength and grace, you broadjump to the far side of the pool.
        
Arriving on the other side and skidding to a stop, you turn to see what has become of the Poachers. Only one head is above the water. He is frantically screaming, “For Grimluk’s sake, Ratikkan, save me!”
        
Before you can move a muscle, you see his head violently jerked under the water.`,
