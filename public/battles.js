up but, fleet of foot, you somersault away from the blurring arc of his sword. Making for the woods, you jump over the other trader, who slowly awakens.

The night is dark, but a sliver of moonlight guides you into the woods. Close behind you, you hear one Medigian Trader yelling to the other. Looking over your shoulder, you see the awakened trader rise and reach for his bow. The first trader sill dogs your heels, screaming foreign curses after you.
        
You scramble over a rock, just in time to hear the hissing of an arrow as it passes overhead and cracks into a stout pine. You aren’t in the clear yet.
        
Before you stretches a broad glade. Your primitive senses scream in alarm. There is something unnatural about this place. Nevertheless, given the choice between possible death at the hands of whatever may be lurking in this strange area and certain death from the sharp weapons of the Medigian Traders, you press on.
        
As you run farther, a soft, growling rumble reaches your ears. You look and see nothing. Before you stands what appears to be a large fir tree. You run toward it. Suddenly, as if summoned by some demon, burning eyes light up near the top of the fir and ignite the scene with an unholy reddish glow.
        
In the light of the glowing eyes, you see that the fir is, in fact, a huge bear, nearly twenty feet in height. He lets out a horrifying roar and flashes his cruel white claws.
        
Your enemies stop in their tracks. Growling ursine curses, red fire burning in its eyes, the bear advances toward you. The battle has shifted. The two traders, who were once your enemies, are now your allies. The bowman hands you his sword. “For now, we are friends.” Then he raises his bow. You have no choice but to fight the Devil-Bear!`,

On the other side of a broad caven, you hit what appears to be another frozen waterfall and slide up it, just barely clearing it before losing your momentum. At the top of the second waterfall, you stop.
        
Standing on top of the second ridge, you peer around. Suddenly, you hear a speedy, swishing sound, and a voice calls to you.
        
“Death to those who would defy the Zokapers.” Out of the gloom appear two men. Thin rails of iron are attached to their boots, and in their hands are deadly barbed whips. They come at you with blinding speed.
        
You draw your sword from your belt and hold it up. As the Zokapers draw nearer, you see that they are small men with pale faces and dark hair that blows back in the wind. They wear strange-looking uniforms that appear to be made of ancient cloth that has been patched hundreds of times in the past centuries, as if handed down from man to man.

You may _not_ flee the Zokapers.`,

A warm wind blows through the corridors. Already, a small puddle of water floods the corridor. From the gloomy depths of the place come the shrill cries of hundreds of animals. In the distance, you see their small, terrified forms running as they would from a fire demon. A lone white squirrel chirps at you, almost accusingly, as it skitters past.
        
Dashing along, you come to the main corridor through which you entered. Now the field of ice is soft and mushy. Sloshing along, you see the gate where the Ice Golem stood. It is your only way out, and you charge toward it.
        
Passing through the gate, you skid to a stop. The bridge, which collapsed as you came across, is still broken. The far ends seem to look tauntingly at you. Thinking that you may be able to jump the bridge, you back up and run straight into something hard.
        
Turning, you see the Ice Golem leering down at you. He is not nearly as formidable as he was the last time you saw him, for already he is beginning to melt and deform. Nevertheless, he is still a dangerous opponent. Your only hope is to defeat him in combat.`,
